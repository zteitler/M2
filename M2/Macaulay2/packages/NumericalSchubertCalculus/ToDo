To Do for the Numerical Schubert Calculus project

Notes from talk with Abraham  Dec 15?

Need to:
 - Find examples where the software breaks and examine them.

 - Make a table comparing all four implementations on the same problem
    for the software paper.

 - Standard input that should work for everything:

   solveMe(SchubertProblem, k, n)

 where SchubertProblem is a list of pairs
   { ( bracket, flag ), (anotherBracket, anotherFlag),...}

 Frank will write a PHC wrapper for this with standard checks 
   (general flag, Schubert problem, etc.)

 the service function verifyInput verifies all inputs, using breaks to return a 
   useful error message to the user.

 First step:  Read the TST and EXA dirctory, as well as the bugs,
