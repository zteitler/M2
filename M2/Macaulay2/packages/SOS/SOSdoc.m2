        the role of the coefficients field
    Description
      Text
        The SOS package works with two coefficient rings: the rational numbers $\QQ$ and the real numbers $\RR$.
        Almost all operations in this package rely on a numerical SDP @TO Solver@.  
        When calling such a solver, even if the input was a polynomial with rational coefficients, the result is numerical.  
        The package makes some effort to round and return a rational result, but this can fail, independent of whether a rational SOS decomposition exists or not.
        In this case of failure, a real result is returned.
        The following example of Scheiderer is SOS, but does not admit any rational SOS decomposition.  Consequently the package must return a real solution:
      Example
        f = library("Scheiderer", QQ[x,y,z])
        sol = solveSOS (f, Solver=>"CSDP");
        sosPoly sol
      Text
        Once the rational world has been left, there is usually now way back.
        The package offers the function @TO (clean,RR,SOSPoly)@ which from an @TO sosPoly@ removes all summands whose coefficient is smaller than a given tolerance.
        This can be useful sometimes and here is how to invoke it:
      Example
        clean (0.001, sosPoly sol)

        A type to store SOS decompositions of polynomials
    Description
      Text
        A polynomial $f\in K[x]$ is a sum-of-squares (SOS) if it can be written as
        $$f = \sum_i d_i g_i^2,$$
        where the $g_i$ are polynomials in $K[x]$ and the $d_i$ are positive weights in $K$.
        This data type stores SOS polynomials in terms of the summands.
        The type is a hash table consisting of the polynomials to be
        squared and summed (the 'generators'), corresponding coefficients,
        and the base ring.  The most common way an SOSPoly comes to life is
	as the result of an SOS decomposition.  See @TO SDPResult@ for more on this.
      Example
        R = QQ[x,y];
        f = 2*x^4+5*y^4-2*x^2*y^2+2*x^3*y;
        sol = solveSOS f;
        sosPoly sol
      Text
        Of course one can also construct SOSPolys by specifying all their ingredients.
      Example
        R = QQ[x,y];
        s = sosPoly(R, {x+1,y}, {2,3} )
        peek s
      Text
        The ingredients of a SOS can be recovered using the expected commands:
      Example
        gens s
        ring s
        coefficients s
      Text
        The length of an SOS is the number of summands:
      Example
        length s
      Text
        Sums of squares support many common operations with polynomials:
      Example
        2 * s
        s + s
        s * s
        s == s
      Text
        The actual polynomial can be recovered using @TO sumSOS@:
      Example
        sumSOS s
      Text
        @TO SOSPoly@ supports the @TO substitute@ command.  
        This cannot be used to change the coefficient field, though.  
        See @TO "coefficients field"@ for some of the limitations.
      Example
        S = QQ[x,y,z];
        sub (s, S)

        This method solves SOS problems.
        Given a rational (or real) polynomial $f(x)$, it attempts to find a rational (or real) 
        positive semidefinite matrix $Q$ and a vector of monomials $mon$ such that
        $$f(x) = mon' Q mon.$$
        The algorithm first computes a floating point solution,
        and then tries to obtain an exact solution by rounding the numerical result. 
        If the rounding fails, the numerical solution is returned.
      Example
        R = QQ[x,y];
        f = 2*x^4+5*y^4-2*x^2*y^2+2*x^3*y;
        sol = solveSOS f;
        Q = sol#GramMatrix
        mon = sol#Monomials
        transpose(mon)*Q*mon - f
      Text
        {\bf SOS with parameters:}
        If the coefficients of the polynomial are linearly parametrized, we can search for parameters which render a polynomial to be a SOS.
        In the following example, the variable $t$ will be treated as a free parameter.
      Example
        R = QQ[x][t];
        f = (t-1)*x^4+1/2*t*x+1;
        sol = solveSOS f;
        sosPoly sol
        sol#Parameters
      Text
        It is possible to solve SOS problems with several parameters.
        In the following example we increase two of the coefficients of the Robinson polynomial until it becomes SOS
      Example
        R = QQ[x,y,z][s,t]
        g = library("Robinson", {x,y,z}) + s*x^6 + t*y^6
        sol = solveSOS g;
        sol#Parameters
      Text
        {\bf SOS with parameter optimization:}
        The method also allows to optimize a linear function of the parameters.
        More precisely, given a polynomial $f(x;p)$ that depends affinely on some parameters $p$, we can solve the problem

        $$min_{p} \, objFun(p) \,\,\, s.t. \,\,\, f(x; p) \, is SOS $$

        In the following example we minimize $-t$ in order to find a lower bound for the polynomial $x^2-3x$:
      Example
        R = QQ[x][t];
        f = x^2 - 3*x - t;
        sol = solveSOS (f, -t, RoundTol=>12);
        sol#Parameters
      Text
        By default the method tries to obtain rational values of the parameters.
        Since there is a trade-off between rounding and optimality, we specify the @TO2 {RoundTol,"rounding precision"}@ as an optional input argument.

        {\bf Caveat}
      Text
        If an SOS decomposition is undertaken in the quotient ring with rational coefficients
        it can happen that rounding fails.  In this case, an @TO SOSPoly@ constructed from the 
        @TO SDPResult@ can live in a newly created ring, instead of the quotient that one started with.
      Example
        R = QQ[x,y]/ideal(x^2 + y^2 - 1);
        f = 10-x^2-y;
        mon = matrix {{1}, {x}, {y}};
        s = solveSOS (f, mon, RoundTol=>infinity);
        ring sosPoly s
      Text
        In this case, one option is to construct a new quotient ring and work there.
        However, this will only work somewhat reliably in the case of a quotient
        modulo a principal ideal, as otherwise the GrÃ¶bner basis engine might
        fail on inexact computations.
      Example
        R' = ring sosPoly s;
        S = R'/(sub (ideal (x^2 + y^2 - 1), R'))
        sub (f, S) == sub (sosPoly s, S)

     Example
        R = QQ[x,y,z];
        h = matrix {{x^2+y^2+y, y-z^2}};
        (sol,mult) = sosInIdeal (h, 2, Solver=>"CSDP");
        sosPoly sol
        h * mult == sosPoly sol
     Text
        The second invocation is on a quotient ring, also with a degree bound.
        This tries to decompose the zero of the quotient ring as a sum-of-squares.
     Example
        S = R/ideal h;
        sol = sosInIdeal (S, 2, Solver=>"CSDP");
        sosPoly sol
        sosPoly sol
    Caveat
        This implementation only works with the @TO2 {Solver,"solvers"}@ "CSDP" and "MOSEK".

    Description
      Text
        This method finds a lower bound for a polynomial or rational function $x\mapsto f(x)$.
        More precisely, this method solves the following relaxation

        $$max \, t \,\,\, s.t. \,\,\, f(x) - t \, is SOS $$

        In some cases the minimizer can be extracted with the method @TO recoverSolution@.
      Example
        R=QQ[x];
        f = (x-1)^2 + (x+3)^2;
        (bound,sol) = lowerBound(f);
        bound
        f - bound == sosPoly sol
      Text
        By default the method tries to obtain a rational lower bound.
        Since there is a trade-off between rounding and optimality, we specify the @TO2 {RoundTol,"rounding precision"}@ as an optional input argument.
      Text
        {\bf Quotient rings:}
        Given an ideal $I$, we can also find a lower bound for $f$ on the variety of $I$.
        This can be done by constructing the associated quotient ring.
        A degree bound must be provided.
      Example
        R = QQ[x,y]/ideal(x^2 - x, y^2 - y);
        f = x - y;
        (bound,sol) = lowerBound(f,2);
        bound
        f - bound == sosPoly sol
      Text
        {\bf Avoiding quotient rings:}
        Constructing the quotient ring is sometimes too expensive since it requires GrÃ¶bner bases.
        There is an alternative (though weaker) relaxation that avoids GrÃ¶bner bases computation.
        Given equations $h_1(x),...h_m(x)$, we can look for multipliers $l_i(x)$ such that $f(x) - t + \sum_i l_i(x) h_i(x)$ is SOS.
      Example
        R = QQ[x,y];
        f = x - y;
        h = matrix{{x^2 - x, y^2 - y}};
        (bound,sol,mult) = lowerBound (f, h, 2);
        bound
        f - bound + h*mult == sosPoly sol

        {\bf Optimizing rational functions:}
        The following is an example of how to optimize a rational function.
      Example
        R = QQ[x];
        f = (x^2-x)/(x^2+1);
        (bound,sol) = lowerBound (f, Solver=>"CSDP");

        This method creates the kernel and image model of the Gram matrices of a polynomial $f$.

        A Gram matrix representation of $f$ is a symmetric matrix $Q$ such that
        $f = mon' Q mon$,
        where $mon$ is a vector of monomials.
        The set of all Gram matrices $Q$ is an affine subspace.
        This subspace can be described in image form as
        $Q = C - \sum_i y_i A_i$,
        or in kernel form as
        $A q = b$
        where $q$ is the @TO2 {smat2vec,"vectorization"}@ of $Q$.

        For parametric SOS problems the image form is
        $Q = C - \sum_i y_i A_i - \sum_j p_j B_j$,
        where $p_j$ are the parameters,

    Consequences
    Description
      Text
        The optional argument {\tt RoundTol} specifies the minimal rounding precision in $d$ binary digits.

        SOS problems are solved numerically using an SDP solver, and afterwards the package attempts to round the floating point solution to rational numbers.
        The rounding strategy is guaranteed to work whenever the space of Gram matrices is full dimensional.
        For SOS optimization problems the rounding may cause a loss in optimality.
        The argument {\tt RoundTol} allows to control the trade-off between optimality and simplicity.
        Higher values of {\tt RoundTol} lead to better solutions.
      Example
        R = QQ[x,z];
        f = x^4+x^2+z^6-3*x^2*z^2;
        (bound,sol) = lowerBound (f,RoundTol=>4);
